Raspberry PI Zero - Car streaming Server
========================================

I needed a solution to stream films to my two sons android tablets
and have them in sync.

Solutions uses a Raspberry PI Zero and an external disk. Streaming
is done using VLC streaming multicast RTP Capabilities.

This repository contains the flask web app to control VLC Streaming
using the RC Telnet interfaz.
